# Sample PBS job script
# squb -v nfiles=blah analyzebindPBS.sh
# runs nfiles=100 if left blank
#
# Copy this script, customize it and then submit it with the ``qsub''
# command. For example:
#
# cp pbs-template.sh myjob-pbs.sh
# {emacs|vi} myjob-pbs.sh
# qsub myjob-pbs.sh
#
# PBS directives are fully documented in the ``qsub'' man page. Directives
# may be specified on the ``qsub'' command line, or embedded in the
# job script.
#
# For example, if you want the batch job to inherit all your environment
# variables, use the ``V'' switch when you submit the job script:

# Note: group all PBS directives at the beginning of your script.
# Any directives placed after the first shell command will be ignored.

### Use the bourne shell
#PBS -S /bin/bash

### Remove only the three initial "#" characters before #PBS
### in the following lines to enable:
###
### To send email when the job is completed:
#PBS -m ae
#PBS -M mist7261@colorado.edu

### Optionally set the destination for your program's output
### Specify localhost and an NFS filesystem to prevent file copy errors.
#PBS -e /Users/mist7261/McHydro/eo/
#PBS -o /Users/mist7261/McHydro/eo/

### Specify the number of cpus for your job.  This example will allocate 4 cores
### using 2 processors on each of 2 nodes.
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=12

### Tell PBS how much memory you expect to use. Use units of 'b','kb', 'mb' or 'gb'.
#PBS -l mem=24GB

### Tell PBS the anticipated run-time for your job, where walltime=HH:MM:SS
### NOTE if the simulation runs longer than this it will be killed
#PBS -l walltime=23:59:59

### Switch to the working directory; by default TORQUE launches processes
### from your home directory.
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
echo Working directory is $PBS_O_WORKDIR

# Calculate the number of processors allocated to this run.
NPROCS=`wc -l < $PBS_NODEFILE`

# Calculate the number of nodes allocated.
NNODES=`uniq $PBS_NODEFILE | wc -l`

### Display the job context
echo Running on host `hostname`
echo Time is `date`
echo Directory is `pwd`
echo Using ${NPROCS} processors across ${NNODES} nodes
echo "Job name: ${PBS_JOBNAME}. Job ID: ${PBS_JOBID}"
echo "Sending email when done"
